# Solution

As far as I know, Google Colab currently does not allow using `%matplotlib notebook` as a backend. Typically, one uses `%matplotlib notebook` for intercativity while making `matplotlib` plots. It appears that the package you are using makes use of `matplotlib` for visualizations. So, for now, you are out of luck!

You will have use other libraries: [**`altair`**][#altair], [**`plotly`**][#plotly], [**`bokeh`**][#bokeh], etc. to achieve interactivity on Colab.

[#bokeh]: https://bokeh.org/

See this colab notebook: [Charting in Colaboratory][#colab-notebook]. There are detailed examples for various visualization packages to get you started in the colab-notebook.

## Sample Altair Code for Interactive Plot on Colab

> [Altair][#altair] is a declarative visualization library for creating interactive visualizations in Python, and is installed and enabled in Colab by default.

For example, here is an interactive scatter plot:

[#altair]: http://altair-viz.github.io/

```python
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data
cars = data.cars()

alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
).interactive()
```
