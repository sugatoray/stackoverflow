# Solution

The following solution uses a *list-comprehension + dict* to produce what you need. However, if you have many values, you may also want to check that each value is getting correctly classified. For that purpose, I would suggest you to use a `dict` instead. 

## Code: Example

```python
# define rules as a dict
rules = {
    'A': [0, 9],
    'B': [10, 19],
    'C': [20, 49],
    'D': [50, 100], 
}

# use a list comprehension: one-line solution
[k for k, v in rules.items() if (min(v) <= x <= max(v))]
```

## Code: output a list of dicts 

This is a quick sanity-check.

```python
values = [0, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20, 30, 45, 49, 50, 60, 80, 100]
[dict((x, k) for k, v in rules.items() if (min(v) <= x <= max(v))) for x in values]
```

**Output**:  

```bash
[{0: 'A'},
 {8: 'A'},
 {9: 'A'},
 {12: 'B'},
 {15: 'B'},
 {19: 'B'},
 {20: 'C'},
 {30: 'C'},
 {45: 'C'},
 {49: 'C'},
 {50: 'D'},
 {60: 'D'},
 {80: 'D'},
 {100: 'D'}]
```

## An alternative: using `pandas` library

```python
# Dummy data
values = [0, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20, 30, 45, 49, 50, 60, 80, 100]
df = pd.DataFrame({'data': values})

# Method-1: "df.assign" + "pd.cut"
df.assign(Rule = pd.cut(df.data, bins = [0, 10, 20, 50, 100], labels = list('ABCD'), include_lowest=True))

# Method-2: just "pd.cut"
df['Rule'] = pd.cut(df.data, bins = [0, 10, 20, 50, 100], labels = list('ABCD'), include_lowest=True)

# Method-3:
pd.cut(values, bins = [0, 10, 20, 50, 100], labels = list('ABCD'), include_lowest=True)
```
