# Solution

You could use the following code to either write multiple dataframes to a single excel file, or each of the dataframes to a single excel file.

```python
target = 'single_file.xlsx'
targets = ['mult_1.xlsx', 'mult_2.xlsx', 'mult_3.xlsx']
# df1 = pd.DataFrame(data_a)
# df2 = pd.DataFrame(data_b)
# df3 = pd.DataFrame(data_c)
# dfs = [pd.DataFrame(x) for x in [data_a, data_b]] # >> in your case
dfs = [df1, df2, df3]

# to write to a single file
write_to_excel(targets = target, dfs = dfs, verbose=1)

# to write to multiple files
write_to_excel(targets = targets, dfs = dfs, verbose=1)
```

## Custom Defined Function

```python
def write_to_excel(targets, dfs: list, verbose=1):
    """Writes single of multiple dataframes to either a single or multiple excel files.

    targets: str or list of str --> path(s) excel files
    dfs: list of dataframes
    Example
    -------
    target = 'single_file.xlsx'
    targets = ['mult_1.xlsx', 'mult_2.xlsx', 'mult_3.xlsx']
    dfs = [df1, df2, df3]

    # to write to a single file
    write_to_excel(targets = target, dfs = dfs, verbose=1)

    # to write to a multiple files
    write_to_excel(targets = targets, dfs = dfs, verbose=1)
    """
    if not isinstance(targets, list):
        targets = [targets]
    writer_scheme = 'single' if len(target)==1 else 'multi'
    if verbose>=1:
        print(f'excel-writer-scheme: {writer_scheme}-file(s)')
    if writer_scheme == 'single':
        with pd.ExcelWriter(targets[0]) as writer:
            for i, df in enumerate(dfs):
                df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=f'Sheet_{i+1}')
    else:
        for df, target in zip(dfs, targets):
            df.to_excel(target, sheet_name='data')
```
