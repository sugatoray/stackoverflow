# Solution

Although I prefer using `importlib.metadata`, since there is another answer already showing how to do that, I will show you another alternative.

For the purpose of illustration, I will use one of my own packages [`genespeak`](https://pypi.org/project/genespeak/) from PyPI.

## With `metadata`

```python
try:
    from importlib import metadata
except ImportError:  # for Python<3.8
    import importlib_metadata as metadata

print(metadata.name('genespeak')) # genespeak
print(metadata.version('genespeak')) # 0.0.7
```

## Use `pkginfo` [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pkginfo/)

We will use the following 5 ways of accessing package information.

```python
from pkginfo import SDist, BDist, Wheel, Installed, Develop
```

### A. Check Package Info from Source Distributions

Typically you would create the source distribution file with:

```sh
python setup.py sdist
```

Assuming you have a `.tar.gz` file at path: `./dist/genespeak-0.0.7.tar.gz`, here is what you need to extract the package info.

```python
from pkginfo import SDist

pkg = SDist("./dist/genespeak-0.0.7.tar.gz")
# Now you can access the metadata fields from 
# PKG-INFO file inside the source file:
# `./dist/genespeak-0.0.7.tar.gz`
print(pkg.name) # genespeak
print(pkg.version) # 0.0.7
```

### B. Check Package Info from Binary Distributions

Typically you would create the binary distribution files (`.egg`) with:

```sh
python setup.py bdist_egg
```

Assuming you have a `.egg` file at path: `./dist/genespeak-0.0.7-py38.egg`, here is what you need to extract the package info. 

```python
from pkginfo import BDist

pkg = BDist("./dist/genespeak-0.0.7-py38.egg")
# Now you can access the metadata fields from 
# the binary distribution file (*.egg):
# `./dist/genespeak-0.0.7-py38.egg`
print(pkg.name) # genespeak
print(pkg.version) # 0.0.7
```

### C. Check Package Info from Wheel

Typically you would create the binary distribution wheel files (`.whl`) with:

```sh
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

Assuming you have a `.whl` file at path: `./dist/genespeak-0.0.7-py3-none-any-whl`, here is what you need to extract the package info.

```python
from pkginfo import Wheel

pkg = Wheel("./dist/genespeak-0.0.7-py3-none-any-whl")
# Now you can access the metadata fields from 
# PKG-INFO file inside the source file:
# `./dist/genespeak-0.0.7-py3-none-any.whl`
print(pkg.name) # genespeak
print(pkg.version) # 0.0.7
```

### D. Check Package Info from Installed Packages

See [here](https://pythonhosted.org/pkginfo/distributions.html#introspecting-installed-packages) for more details

```python
from pkginfo import Installed
import genespeak

pkg = Installed(genespeak)
# Now you can access the metadata fields from 
# PKG-INFO file inside the source file:
# `./dist/genespeak-0.0.7.tar.gz`
print(pkg.name) # genespeak
print(pkg.version) # 0.0.7
```

### E. Check Package Info from Development Directory

```python
from pkginfo import Develop

dev = Develop(".")
# Now you can access the metadata fields from 
# PKG-INFO file under `genespeak.egg-info` 
# directory under the project root.
print(dev.name) # genespeak
print(dev.version) # 0.0.7
```
