# Solution

You could use the following methods.  

## Method-1: Microsoft speech engine (Tested on Windows 10)

On Windows 10 platform, you could use the following alternative.  

```python
import win32com.client as wincl
speaker = wincl.Dispatch("SAPI.SpVoice")
speaker.Speak("Hello World")

```
## Method-2: Use `gtts` + `pygame` (OS Independent Solution)
Here you could use `gtts` to save the text as an mp3 file and then load and play it using `pygame`.  

### Step-1: Saving Text as MP3 file

```python
#pip install gTTS
from gtts import gTTS
tts = gTTS(text='Good morning', lang='en')
tts.save("good.mp3")
```

### Step-2: Loading and Playing the MP3 file

```python
#pip install pygame
from pygame import mixer

mixer.init()
mixer.music.load('good.mp3')
mixer.music.play()
```

**Another option**: Use VLC MediaPlayer to play the MP3 file.    

```python
#pip install python-vlc
import vlc
p = vlc.MediaPlayer("good.mp3")
p.play()
```

## Method-3: Directly Text-to-Speech Playing from Buffer 

No need to save as an mp3 file.

from io import BytesIO

# Use gTTS to Store Speech on Buffer
tts = gTTS(text='Good morning', lang='en')
mp3 = BytesIO()
tts.write_to_fp(mp3)
mp3.seek(0)

# Play from Buffer
mixer.init()
mixer.music.load(mp3)
mixer.music.play()
```
