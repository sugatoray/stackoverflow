# Solution

Apart from what others have suggested as answers, you could also do this using `pandas` library. This may not be optimal if you have very little need for using `pandas`. But given the many scenarios where one could use `pandas`, here is an option. 

> ðŸ‘‰ The **benchmarking** section below shows that *a typical list length of `1e8` (i.e **100 Million**), the wall time for execution is about **`23 seconds`**. For **one million** records the execution time is around `350 ms`*.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'ID': list_of_IDs, 'VALUE': list_of_values})
df.groupby('ID')['VALUE'].apply(list).to_dict()

## Output: 
# {0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [0, 1, 2, 3], 2: [0], 3: [1, 2], 100: [8, 9, 10]}
```

## Single line solution

You could equivalently write all the operations as a chain of operations and get what you want in a single line (broken into multiple lines for enhanced readability) as follows.

```python
pd.DataFrame({
    'ID': list_of_IDs, 
    'VALUE': list_of_values
}).groupby('ID')['VALUE'].apply(list).to_dict()

## Output: 
# {0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [0, 1, 2, 3], 2: [0], 3: [1, 2], 100: [8, 9, 10]}
```

## Dummy Data

```python
list_of_IDs    = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 100, 100, 100]
list_of_values = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Benchmarking Speed of Execution ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Let us first prepare some dummy data (`N = 1e4, 1e5, 1e6, 1e7, 1e8`) and then use this data to benchmark the execution (wall) time. It shows that a typical list length of `1e8` (i.e **100 Million**), the wall time for execution is about 23 seconds. For **one million** records the execution time is around `350 ms`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

N = 1e8
N = int(N)
ids = np.random.randint(low=0, high=100, size=N)
values = np.random.randint(low=0, high=10, size=N)
```

I used a Google Colab notebook and rand the following in a cell with the data prepared in above.

```python
# run in a notebook
%%time 
d = pd.DataFrame({
    'ID': ids, 
    'VALUE': values
}).groupby('ID')['VALUE'].apply(list).to_dict()
```

**Output**:

```bash
|  N  | CPU Times (user, sys, total) | Wall Time |
|-----|------------------------------|-----------|
| 1e8 | (18.5  s, 4.38  s, 22.9  s)  | 23  s     |
| 1e7 | (2.19  s, 212  ms, 2.4   s)  | 2.4  s    |
| 1e6 | (317  ms, 31.6 ms, 348  ms)  | 352 ms    |
| 1e5 | (28.5 ms, 10.9 ms, 39.4 ms)  | 42  ms    |
| 1e4 | (12.6 ms, 2.92 ms, 15.5 ms)  | 18  ms    |
```
