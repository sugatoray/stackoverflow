# Solution

**Your code does not work because** you are essentially evaluating the difference of the first row of the square matrix from itself.

```python
# this picks up members of first row (left to right)
sumleftdiagonal += lis[0 + counter]
# this picks up members of first row (right to left)
sumrightdiagonal += [n - counter]
counter += 1
```

You can verify that `sumleftdiagonal  = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `sumrightdiagonal = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` for the dummy data I used.

## Purely pythonic solution.

### Method-1: `just python`

```python
# using the dummy data below: sum(diag_left - diag_right) = 0
n = arr[0]
sum([arr[1+n*i+i] - arr[1+(n-1)*(i+1)] for i in range(n)])
```

**Output**:

```bash
0
```

## Using `numpy`

If you can use `numpy` then there are at least two methods.

### Method-2: using `numpy`

```python
import numpy as np

def diagdiff(arr):
    n, arr = arr[0], arr[1:]
    arr = np.array(arr).reshape((n,n))
    return sum(np.diag(arr) - np.diag(np.fliplr(arr)))

# Dummy Data
a = np.arange(25).reshape((5,5)) + 1
print(f'square-array: \n\n{a}\n')
arr = [int(np.sqrt(a.size))] + a.flatten().tolist()
dd = diagdiff(arr)
print(f'diagonal-difference: {dd}')
```

**Output**:

```bash
square-array:

[[ 1  2  3  4  5]
 [ 6  7  8  9 10]
 [11 12 13 14 15]
 [16 17 18 19 20]
 [21 22 23 24 25]]

diagonal-difference: 0
```

### Method-3: using `numpy`

```python
n, a = arr[0], np.array(arr[1:])
a = a.reshape((n,n))
sum([a[i, 0+i] - a[i, -(1+i)] for i in range(n)])
```

**Output**:

```bash
0
```
