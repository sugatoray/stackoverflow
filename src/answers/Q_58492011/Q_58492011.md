# Solution

First of all, your code was not properly indented. I have corrected that.
The function `myfunction` takes in a `list` (`open_numbers`) as input and should return it as well.

I have passed in the output of `number1()` as the input to `myfunction()`. This should create a list: `[1, 1]`. And that's what it did.

```python
def number1():
    x = 1
    open_numbers = []
    open_numbers.append(x)
    return open_numbers

def myfunction(open_numbers):
    y = 1
    open_numbers.append(y)
    return open_numbers

myfunction(number1())
```

**Output**:

```bash
[1, 1]
```
