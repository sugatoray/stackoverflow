# Solution

Your website has `javascript`. When you click on the <kbd>next page</kbd>, it fires a `javascript` function to populate the result. You could use **`Selenium`** browser automation to programatically access other pages.

## Pagination with Selenium

## Core Steps

You need to breakdown your problem in to the following steps:

1. Use `Selenium` (with python) BrowserAutomation to access your page.
1. Get the total number of pages (see in the page source, at the very end, it has a pagination section). Althernatively, you could use `total_pages = total_results//max_results + 1` where, `max_results = 25` by default.

1. For _each page_:

    1. Use `BeautifulSoup` to extract the data from the response object obtained using Selenium.

    1. Use `selenium` to click on the <kbd>next page</kbd> link

    1. Append the results in a `dict` or a `list` or to a `pandas.DataFrame` if you like.
