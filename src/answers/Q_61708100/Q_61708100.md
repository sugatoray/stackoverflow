# Solution

The solution here demands clarity on a few concepts as follows. I will explain these concepts in the following sections.

- what `keras` expects as inputs
- what kind of modifications could be done to your `keras` model to allow sparse input matrices
- converting a 2D `numpy` array to a 3D `numpy` array
- back-and-forth conversion between a sparse and a non-sparse (or, dense) array using
  - `scipy.sparse.coo_matrix` for 2D `numpy` array
  - `sparse.COO` for 3D `numpy` array

## Using sparse matrices as input to `tf.keras` models

- One option is to convert your sparse input matrix into the non-sparse (dense) format using `todense()` method. This makes the matrix a regular `numpy` array. See kaggle discussion, [[3]][#ref-3] and [[4]][#ref-4].

- Another option is to write your own custom Layers for both sparse and dense inputs by subclassing `tf.keras.layers.Layer` class. See this article, [[2]][#ref-2].

- It appears that `tensorflow.keras` now allows model training with sparse weights. So, somewhere it has the ability to handle sparsity. You may want to explore the documentation, [[1][#ref-1]] for this aspect.

## Adding a new-axis to a numpy array

You can add another axis to a numpy array using `np.newaxis` as follows.

```python
import numpy as np

## Make a 2D array
a2D = np.zeros((10,10))

# Make a few elements non-zero in a2D
aa = a2D.flatten()
aa[[0,13,41,87,98]] = np.random.randint(1,10,size=5)
a2D = aa.reshape(a2D.shape)

# Make 3D array from 2D array by adding another axis
a3D = a2D[:,:,np.newaxis]
#print(a2D)
print('a2D.shape: {}\na3D.shape: {}'.format(a2D.shape, a3D.shape))
```

**Output**:

```
a2D.shape: (10, 10)
a3D.shape: (10, 10, 1)
```

Having said that, please take a look at the links in the **References** section.


## Sparse Arrays

Since a sparse array has very few non-zero values, a regular numpy array when converted into a sparse array, stores it in a few sparse-formats:

- `csr_matrix`: row-wise arrays of non-zero values and indices
- `csc-matrix`: column-wise array of nonzero values and indices
- `coo-matrix`: a table with three columns
  + row
  + column
  + non-zero value

**Scipy Sparse Matrices expect 2D input-matrix**

However, `scipy.sparse` implementations of the above three types of sparse-matrices, only considers 2D non-sparse matrix as input.

```python
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix, coo_matrix

coo_a2D = coo_matrix(a2D)
coo_a2D.shape # output: (10, 10)

# scipy.sparse only accepts 2D input matrices
# the following line will throw an !!! ERROR !!!
coo_a3D = coo_matrix(coo_a2D.todense()[:,:,np.newaxis])
```

### Sparse Matrix from 3D non-sparse input matrix

Yes, you can do this using the [`sparse`](https://github.com/pydata/sparse) library. It also supports `scipy.sparse` and `numpy` arrays. To convert from sparse matrix to non-sparse (dense) format (_this is NOT a Dense Layer in neural networks_), use the `todense()` method.

```python
## Installation
# pip install -U sparse

import sparse

## Create sparse coo_matrix from a
# 3D numpy array (dense format)
coo_a3D = sparse.COO(a3D)

## Test that
#   coo_a3D == coo made from (coo_a2D + newaxis)
print(
    (coo_a3D == sparse.COO(coo_a2D.todense()[:,:,np.newaxis])).all()
) # output: True
## Convert to dense (non-sparse) format
#   use: coo_a3D.todense()
print((a3D == coo_a3D.todense()).all()) # output: True
```
