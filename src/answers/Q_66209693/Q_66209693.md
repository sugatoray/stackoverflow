# Solution

`lda.fit(X, y)` does not return anything and hence you cannot call the method called `.transform()` on it. The API will allow you to call a method only if it is already defined. Please see the documentation.

Change it to this. I would also encourage you to spend more time on the documentation.

```python
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=2)

# either use: lda.fit_transform(X, y)
X_r2 = lda.fit_transform(X, y)

## PREFERRED WAY
# or, use: lda.fit(X, y)
# followed by lda.transform(X)
lda.fit(X, y)
X_r2 = lda.transform(X)
```
