# Solution

It appears that this is an [open-github-issue][#github-issue] for tensorflow, currently under development and _named-output_ has not yet been implemented using a `dict`.

[#github-issue]: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34114

The [documentation for `Model.fit()`][#keras-model-fit] shows that currently the input, `x` could be a _named-input_ by using a `dict`, however, the output, `y` does not accept any `dict` yet.

[#keras-model-fit]: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#fit

```python
fit(
    x=None, y=None, batch_size=None, epochs=1, verbose=1, callbacks=None,
    validation_split=0.0, validation_data=None, shuffle=True, class_weight=None,
    sample_weight=None, initial_epoch=0, steps_per_epoch=None,
    validation_steps=None, validation_freq=1, max_queue_size=10, workers=1,
    use_multiprocessing=False, **kwargs
)
```

Where,

**INPUT**, `x` = either a numpy array/list-of-arrays or a tensor or a dict or a generator.
> A dict mapping input names to the corresponding array/tensors, if the model has named inputs.

**OUTPUT**, `y` = either a numpy array or tensor or not specified when x is a generator.
