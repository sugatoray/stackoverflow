# Solution

Yes. Make the pipeline first. Then treat the pipeline as your model and pass it to GridSearchCV.

Your problem is in the following line (you had it mislabeled):

Replace `MLPRegressor__` with `mlpregressor__`.

> **The Fix**: 
>
> - The pipeline `named_step` for `MLPRegressor` estimator was mislabeled as `MLPRegressor__` in the `param_grid`. 
> - Changing it to `mlpregressor__` fixed the problem.

You may run and check it in this colab notebook.

```python
# INCORRECT
param_grid = {
    'MLPRegressor__hidden_layer_sizes': [(16, 16,), (64, 64,), (128, 128,)], 
    'MLPRegressor__activation': ['identity', 'logistic', 'tanh', 'relu'],
    'MLPRegressor__solver': ['adam', 'sgd'],
}

# CORRECTED
param_grid = {
    'mlpregressor__hidden_layer_sizes': [(16, 16,), (64, 64,), (128, 128,)], 
    'mlpregressor__activation': ['identity', 'logistic', 'tanh', 'relu'],
    'mlpregressor__solver': ['adam', 'sgd'],
}
```

## Note

The key to understand what was wrong here, was to observe the last two lines of the error stack.

```sh
ValueError: Invalid parameter MLPRegressor for estimator Pipeline(steps=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler()),
                ('mlpregressor', MLPRegressor())]). Check the list of available parameters with `estimator.get_params().keys()`.
```
