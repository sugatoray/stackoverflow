## Solution: OpenCV installation for Python using `conda` ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ <kbd>Super Easy âœ¨</kbd>

Try creating a new environment first. If you are using conda, it is better to use `conda install` whenever possible over `pip install`. You need to specify the channel `conda-forge` for opencv (it has the most updated version on conda). 

The following command should do it.
```
conda create -n opencv_env python=3.8 -c conda-forge opencv numpy matplotlib scipy
```

Once installed, activate the environment with `conda activate opencv_env`.

However, for reproducibility, I would encourage you to create an `environment.yml` file and create/update the environment easily whenever necessary. See [here][#conda-env-with-yml-file] for more details on it.

[#conda-env-with-yml-file]: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

Save the following as `environment.yml` file. And then run `conda env create -f environment.yml` from the same location as the `environment.yml` file.


```yaml
### filename: environment.yml
#
### To create environment run:
#   conda env create -f environment.yml
#
### To update environment run:
#   conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
#
### Note: 
# The --prune option causes conda to remove any 
# dependencies that are no longer required from 
# the environment.
#
### Activating the environment
#   conda activate opencv_env
#
### Deactivating the environment
#   conda deactivate opencv_env


name: opencv_env # <-- The name of the environment
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - opencv # -c conda-forge
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scipy
  - pip:
    # list packages for which "pip install <package>" is necessary
    #- hypothesis
```
