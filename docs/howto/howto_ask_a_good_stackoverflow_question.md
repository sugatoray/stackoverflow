## How to ask a good question on Stackoverflow? :star:

> **The golden rule of asking any question is to connect with your audience and explain your 
question with examples, whenever possible.**

The questions you ask, unless your audience grasps your question clearly, they would either 
wait for more information or they will simply choose to skip answering your question.


I have seen often many new users of stackoverflow asking questions that from the following pitfalls:

- not properly formatted 
  - should learn how to use markdown to write properly formatted questions/answers.
- properly presented 
  - should try to rephrase the question by breaking it down in coherent sections, if necessary.
  - examples are always helpful
  - plots/diagrams could speak volumes (if used where applicable)
- without adequate information
- does not mention:
  - what they have now (current state)
  - what they want from the solution (future state)
  - what they have done (current progress)
    > _this could be an explanation of the strategy/code they have tried so far._

This should help new stackoverflow users on to 
self-educate themselves:

> Always provide a complete [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with code, **data, errors, current output, and expected output**, as **[formatted text](https://stackoverflow.com/help/formatting)**. If relevant, only plot images are okay. Please see [How to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
